# Software-development-tools-labs
<h1> Lab ITMO </h1> 
This repository was created specifically for laboratory work on the subject of software development tools. 
<h3> Lab1 </h3>
A small project has been written and is now in this repository. It includes three classes: 
<li> Fraction </li>
<li>Polynom</li>
<li>Equation </li>
<h3> Lab2 </h3>
In this lab, I needed to work with Git and GitHub, so I wrote this ReadMe.
It is also worth noting that other repositories, namely <b>"Add-to-ArrayList"</b> and <b>"ParseString"</b>, also belong to this lab.
